# quarantine-digest

Test project about email digest. This has 2 section `emails` and `config`. The `Emails` shows all the emails with pagination however the pagination implementation is not complete yet, when is more than 20 pages only is possible to access to the emails of the first 20 pages and the last page. The `config` give the possibility to set when the app check for new emails nevertheless it is only a UI simulation, it means that the application will check anyway new emails every 1 minute. Please consider that once the server is off the next that the server is running will generate different emails because it is saved in memory instead of database
